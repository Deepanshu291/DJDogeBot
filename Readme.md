## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get DJDogeBot up and running in your Discord server.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- Discord.py library installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```shell
  pip install discord.py
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the DJDogeBot repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu291/DJDogeBot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd DJDogeBot
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended but optional):
   ```shell
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment (if you created one):
   - On Windows:
     ```shell
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```shell
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required packages:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Set up your bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You'll need to create a new bot, get its token, and invite it to your server.

7. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your bot's token:
   ```py
   
       TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
   
   ```

8. Run the bot:
   ```shell
   python bot.py
   ```

Your DJBot should now be running and ready to respond to commands in your Discord server.
